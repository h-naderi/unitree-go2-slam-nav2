# Unitree-Go2 Robot: SLAM and Nav2 Demos

Welcome to the **Unitree-Go2 Robot SLAM and Nav2** repository! This project showcases the integration of SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and autonomous navigation using Nav2 on the Unitree-Go2 robot. Currently, this repository primarily includes demonstration videos. In the coming weeks, I will be adding the code, documentation, and additional details about the robot setup and the overall project.
