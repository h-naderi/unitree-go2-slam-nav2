# Unitree-Go2 Robot: SLAM and Nav2 Demos

Welcome to the **Unitree-Go2 Robot SLAM and Nav2** repository! This project showcases the integration of SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and autonomous navigation using Nav2 on the Unitree-Go2 robot. Currently, this repository primarily includes demonstration videos. In the coming weeks, I will be adding the code, documentation, and additional details about the robot setup and the overall project.

## Overview

- **Robot Platform**: [Unitree-Go2](https://www.unitree.com/products/go2)
- **SLAM**: Multiple SLAM frameworks supported (e.g., SLAM Toolbox, RTAB-Map, etc.)
- **Navigation**: ROS 2 Nav2
- **Primary Objective**: Demonstrate the feasibility of autonomous mapping and navigation on a quadruped robot.

### Key Features

- **Real-time mapping** in indoor or outdoor environments
- **Obstacle avoidance** using Nav2 and sensor data
- **Autonomous path planning** to specified goals
- **Future expansions** to incorporate advanced perception or multi-robot collaboration

## Demo Videos

Here are links to demonstration videos showing the current capabilities. (Choose your preferred method: embed from YouTube, link to cloud storage, or upload directly to GitHub if they’re small enough.)
